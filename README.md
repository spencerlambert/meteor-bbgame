This is a simple Meteor app that publishes a score of a basket ball game.  It's unique in that the score is tracked as a server side object, rather than a MongoDB, showing an example of how you can publish any data over Meteor's DDP.  

The files in the public folder are an example of how to subscribe to the game scores using browser javascript, demo'ing that the client can be fully decoupled from Meteor.
